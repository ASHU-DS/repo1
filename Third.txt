This is my Third file in GIT repository

Version numbers in GIT are given to CHANGES to the repository

Each file does NOT have a version number

So, what is versioned is the CHANGES and not the FILES

Which means that if I add 2 files together .. they will together form a version.

1. First.txt 							   - v1
2. Second.txt and Third.txt 			   - v2
3. Fourth.txt, Fifth.txt and Sixth.txt     - v3
4. Change to Text inside First.txt         - v4
5. Delete Second.txt (This is also change) - v5


What happens when you do a checkout: 

1. git checkout 37e3b7f67b6ddb1b1387e06bac7fdccb56003c15

This command will automatically create an anonymous branch (copy) of the repository and in this branch it will load the version that you are requesting. The original branch (master) still exists and you can easily go back to it. 

This is useful, when you want to temporarily checkout a previous version and then restore it to the original version
